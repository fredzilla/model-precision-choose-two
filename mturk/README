This is the code for facilitating the Mechanical Turk experiments.

To use do the following:
    0. Fill in your Mechanical Turk ID and Secret Key in both of the python files.
    1. Construct your input file like "out.final.csv". The ID for each row must be unique, and the "Ground Truth Word", and "Ground Truth Label" should have correct values.
    2. Run 'python 02_make_hits_groups.py > ids.txt' to upload the HITs to MTurk.
    3. After the HITS have finished (their progress can be monitored using the AMT site), download them using 'python 03_get_hits.py'.
